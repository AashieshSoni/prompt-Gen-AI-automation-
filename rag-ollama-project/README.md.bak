1. Setup Instructions
Step 1: Create project folder
mkdir rag-ollama-project
cd rag-ollama-project

Step 2: Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate     # Linux / Mac
# OR
# .venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

Step 3: Install Ollama Python SDK
pip install ollama chromadb

Step 4: Pull required Ollama models
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
ollama pull llama3.1           # or your preferred LLM

Step 5: Run the App
python rag_app.py

Step : 6

RAG Response:
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) combines search with LLMs to improve accuracy...


ecommendation Based on “Automation / REST API Testing” Use Case

If you're building a testable RAG API (for automated testing), anarojoecheburua/RAG-with-Langchain-and-FastAPI or AshishSinha5/rag_api are probably the most straightforward.

If you want something more “production/hybrid search” ready, Hybrid-Search-RAG (kolhesamiksha) or Hybrid-Search-For-Rag (Syed007Hassan) are strong picks.

For cloud-based, enterprise-style RAG, the Azure Samples repo is a very good reference.



Here are some existing GitHub repositories for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in Python that expose REST APIs (or can be adapted for testing automation). Depending on your exact use case (local LLM, cloud LLM, vector store), some will be more relevant than others.
Existing GitHub Repos for Python RAG + REST API

anarojoecheburua / RAG-with-Langchain-and-FastAPI

Uses LangChain, FastAPI for API endpoints, text splitting, embedding, retrieval + generation. 
GitHub

Good for building a scalable RAG backend service.

AshishSinha5 / rag_api

Retrieval Augmented Generation with LLMs + FastAPI. 
GitHub

Designed for Q&A over custom documents using a REST API.

Azure-Samples / app-service-rag-openai-ai-search-python

Demonstrates RAG using Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and FastAPI, deployable to Azure App Service. 
GitHub

Good reference if you're okay with Azure services, or want a production-oriented example.

kolhesamiksha / Hybrid-Search-RAG

A Python package for hybrid RAG. Includes a FastAPI REST API in its example. 
GitHub

Combines vector search + other retrieval mechanisms.

Syed007Hassan / Hybrid-Search-For-Rag

Demonstrates hybrid search (vector + keyword) for RAG using Postgres + PgVector, with a FastAPI app. 
GitHub

Useful if you want to use Postgres as your vector DB.

hritikpal671 / RAG-using-FastAPI

RAG chatbot backend in Python, with FastAPI and LangChain + FAISS. 
GitHub

Has also a Streamlit frontend integrated — handy for testing UIs + APIs.

tansut / Rag-LangChain-Chainlit-FastAPI

Chatbot app built with LangChain, FastAPI, Chainlit, and FAISS. 
GitHub

Chainlit can help in building conversational UI, but you can use it purely as a backend API too.

sinanuozdemir / oreilly-retrieval-augmented-gen-ai

A more advanced setup combining RAG + agents + real-time data. 
GitHub

Good for more dynamic or production-grade systems.
